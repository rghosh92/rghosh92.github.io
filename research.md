I explore the intersection of **machine learning**, **information theory**, and **computer vision**, with a focus on building principled algorithms that generalize reliably across noisy, high-dimensional environments. My work spans both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, with recent efforts aimed at understanding complexity, representation, and structure in modern learning systems.

### Current Research Themes

- **Novel Neural Architectures & Computation**  
  Designing novel computational units and representations for deep learning systems that go beyond standard layers and activation functions.

- **Complexity & Generalization**  
  Investigating new mathematical measures of complexity to explain why certain learning models generalize better than others.

- **Structural Biases in Tabular Learning**  
  Injecting inductive priors into tabular data models to handle sparsity, noise, and high dimensionality with greater robustness.
