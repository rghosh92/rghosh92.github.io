Hi, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the National University of Singapore.

My work explores the intersection of **machine learning**, **information theory**, and **computer vision**. I develop robust algorithms for deep learning and investigate how we can measure shared information in high-dimensional data.

### Current Interests
- New Computational Units for Learning Architectures
- New Measures of Complexity for Understanding Learning and Generalization
- Injecting Structural Inductive Biases in Tabular Data Learning

### Selected Publications
Check out my [Publications](/publications/) for recent papers and featured research.
